== TODO:

- Consider moving the CSV generation stuff out of Date/Time tables
    - this could easily be just moved into the Script::DB::GenerateAllCSVs module
        - and that could be renamed GenerateDateTimeDimensionDataCSVs or something

- Consider moving the git-commit extraction out of Commit table
    - This can also be more robust perhaps
